## ðŸš¦ Data Got Messy? TRACE It Back to Clarity

An intuitive framework for analysts and data scientists to solve messy data problems with precision and scalability.

### The TRACE Framework
This framework ensures that data cleaning isnâ€™t just reactive, itâ€™s thoughtful, scalable, and client-ready. 
Use TRACE to uncover the story behind your data, avoid hidden pitfalls, document and evaluate the magnitude of the issues.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **T â€“ Tag issues** | Eyeball for obvious issues: missing values, inconsistencies, outliers, and variations of duplicate|
| **R â€“ Review structure** | Understand what each row represents, explore schema, and map columns to business context |
| **A â€“ Amend selectively** | Clean new columns without overwriting the original sourceâ€”preserve raw data integrity |
| **C â€“ Check for conflicts** | Surface unsolvable issues like nulls, timestamp anomalies, and business logic violations |
| **E â€“ Establish documentation** | Log all identified issues and evaluate their magnitude. This helps prioritise fixes!|
