## ðŸš¦ Data Got Messy? TRACE It Back to Clarity

An intuitive framework for analysts and data scientists to solve messy data problems with precision and scalability.

### The TRACE Framework

- **T â€“ Tag issues**  
  Identify common data problems:
  - Missing values  
  - Duplicate variants (exact, fuzzy, structural)  
  - Inconsistent formats  
  - Outliers  

- **R â€“ Review structure**  
  Understand what each row represents, explore the schema, and map columns to business context.

- **A â€“ Amend selectively**  
  Clean or engineer new columns without overwriting the original sourceâ€”preserve raw integrity.

- **C â€“ Check for logic conflicts**  
  Surface deeper issues, including:
  - Timestamp anomalies  
  - Invalid categories  
  - Broken relationships  

- **E â€“ Establish documentation**  
  Log all issues, decisions, assumptions, and fixes to ensure transparency and support future collaboration.

Use TRACE to bring clarity, confidence, and repeatability to your data cleaning processâ€”especially in scalable, client-facing environments.
