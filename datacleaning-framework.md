## 🚦 Data Got Messy? TRACE It Back to Clarity
A practical 5-step framework to clean complex data.

## 🧱 The CLEAN Framework

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **T – Tag issues** | Eyeball for obvious issues: missing values, inconsistencies, outliers, and variations of duplicate|
| **R – Review structure** | Understand what each row represents, explore schema, and map columns to business context |
| **A – Amend selectively** | Clean new columns without overwriting the original source—preserve raw data integrity |
| **C – Check for conflicts** | Surface unsolvable issues like nulls, timestamp anomalies, and business logic violations |
| **E – Establish documentation** | Log all identified issues and evaluate their magnitude.|
