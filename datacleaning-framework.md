## ðŸš¦ Data Got Messy? TRACE It Back to Clarity

An intuitive framework for analysts and data scientists to solve messy data problems with precision and scalability.

### The TRACE Framework

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **T â€“ Tag issues** | Identify common data problemsâ€”missing values, duplicate variants, inconsistent formats, outliers |
| **R â€“ Review structure** | Understand what each row represents, explore schema, and map columns to business context |
| **A â€“ Amend selectively** | Clean or engineer new columns without overwriting the original sourceâ€”preserve raw integrity |
| **C â€“ Check for logic conflicts** | Surface deeper issuesâ€”e.g. timestamp anomalies, invalid categories, or broken relationships |
| **E â€“ Establish documentation** | Log issues, decisions, fixes, assumptions, and flags for transparency and future collaboration |

Use TRACE to uncover the story behind your data, avoid hidden pitfalls, and deliver insights with confidence.
