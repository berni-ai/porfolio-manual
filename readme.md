# ðŸ§¹ Series 1: The CLEAN Framework for Data Cleaning

Before you analyze, **CLEAN your data**.

This framework captures the five essential steps to prepare messy data for meaningful use. It balances technical rigor with practical, real-world application.

| Step | Meaning                        | Purpose                                                                                  |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C    | **Conceptualize the data**     | Understand what each column means and how it connects to your business or research goal. |
| L    | **Locate solvable issues**     | Identify and isolate fixable issues like typos, formatting inconsistencies, or duplicates. |
| E    | **Evaluate unsolvable issues** | Spot tricky problems like nulls, ambiguous values, or data loss that require judgment.    |
| A    | **Augment & resolve issues**   | Apply logical, documented fixesâ€”cleaning with intention, not guesswork.                  |
| N    | **Note & document changes**    | Create a changelog for traceability and future reproducibility.                          |
